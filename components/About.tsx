					<h1>Meet The Author.</h1>
					<p>
						Embukane Vincent Libosso Bengoh started his career at the beginning
						of 2010 as a blogger, after a one month training at Nation Media
						Group in August. With a vast grasp in the events and entertainment
						industry, Kenya Buzz and later on, UP Magazine came calling. From a
						staff writer, he rose to an online Digital Content Manager. He
						worked there for a year (2015) before taking on a new challenge at
						What’s Good Studios.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2017, he graduated with a Diploma in Communication from Daystar
						University. At What’s Good Studios he took on the roles on online
						Managing Editor for their publishing platform, an online radio and
						TV host. Libosso, better known as The Events Kahuna is not new to
						the heavy-atmosphere of Nairobi’s Digital airwaves (often
						crisscrossing into Uganda with Festival coverage and celebrity
						interviews). The key to his success has been an unsinkable passion
						for radio, TV, content marketing and creation, music and people.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2020, alongside co-presenters Rafiiki and Blak Ice, Libosso aka
						Vinny Puppa Rankin received the prestigious 2020 Sondeka Award for
						Best Online Radio and Podcast award for their straight reggae and
						dancehall show, #LazeReggae Invasion Podcast.
